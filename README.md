# Steam_profile_searcher

Little project that will use https://pypi.org/project/python-steam-api/ to search steam profiles and then display the info in main window 
Please note that this is only a amateur learning project that I do in free time.

How to use it? 
For now it only shows steam name, profile picture and status but i would like to add some more things later . 
As for 29 july i added recen game played and also a profile link.
but to achieve something you need to add your https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey to enviroment variable

in cmd or powershell:
$env:STEAM_API_KEY="key"
python steam_prof.py

or in IDE add enviromental variable and launch it. 

# To launch from exe!!!
To get the app to work while using exe from releases first you need to add enviromental to your system or you can add it to the bat file i prpared. If you dont do it the app will say you that you have put the wrong steamid
