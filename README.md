# Steam_profile_searcher

Little project that will use https://pypi.org/project/python-steam-api/ to search steam profiles and then display the info in main window 
Please note that this is only a amateur learning project that I do in free time.

#How to use it? 
for now it only shows steam name, profile picture and status but i would like to add some more things later . 
but to achieve something you need to add your https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey to enviroment variable

in cmd or powershell:
$env:STEAM_API_KEY="key"
python steam_prof.py

or in IED add enviromental variable and launch it
